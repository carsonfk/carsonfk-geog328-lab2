                    <i>Dead Space</i> is a sci-fi horror game series published and owned by Electronic Arts (EA). 
                    The primary developer of the series was Visceral Games, which developed the main three entries in the series. 
                    Additionally, two spinoff games were released, alongside a mobile port of the first game. 
                    In 2023, a ground-up remake of the first game by Motive Studio was released by EA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The games are set in the 26th century during an outbreak of an undead alien species, called Necromorphs, across the solar system.

                    Players control an engineer named Isaac Clarke as he and a team of specialists arrive to investigate the USG Ishimura's mysterious blackout. 
                    After docking with the ship, they discover a Necromorph outbreak is to blame. 
                    Isaac must survive long enough to escape the overrun ship, ultimately leading him to discover source of the outbreak and his persistant hallucinations.

                <p>
                    Released in 2008, the game was very sucessful for EA, selling over a million copies and receiving excellent reviews.

                    Isaac Clarke returns in Dead Space 2, now haunted by worsened hallucinations. 
                    He wakes up on space station orbiting Saturn, which is also facing its own Necromorph outbreak. 
                    Here Isaac encounters new survivors and new Necromorphs, alongside new disturbing details and developments surrounding the events of the first game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dead Space 2 was also very sucessful when it released in 2011, with sales and review scores nearly as high as those of the first game.

            <button class="accordion">Dead Space 3</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A few years later, Isaac Clarke battles another outbreak on a distant Earth colony on Tau Volantis, where he hopes to end the Necromorph outbreaks for good.

                    Critical and commercial reception of Dead Space 3, which released in 2013, was significantly below those of the first two games, in part due to a reduced focus on horror, 
                    addition of cooperative play and in-game purchases, and an overall lack of innovation or improvements.

                    A remake of the 2008 game, the plot is largely unchanged aside from a few minor changes and additions to both written and spoken dialogue. 
                    The changes included in the remake were primarily focused on updating the objectively outdated aspects of the game, such as visuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Released in 2023 - nearly 10 years after Dead Space 3 - the game was recieved very positively critically and comercially.
                    This success can be attributed to the graphical, audio, and gameplay overhauls, which were seen as both impressive and faithful to the original game.
